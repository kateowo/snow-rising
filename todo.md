## main
- [x] copy over lava rising
  - [x] replace 'lava' references with 'powdered_snow'
  - [x] replace 'lava'-esc sfx
  - [x] use more snow(ier)/christmas colours and things

- [x] give player slowness if certain blocks away from snow? (`slow_nearby_distance`)
  - ^ i don't think you can trigger the powdered snow effect manually
  - will trial it out

## QOL
- [ ] double food drops?
- [x] add some sort of snow food?

## extras
- [x] add custom items (like water rising)
  - ensure these items are encouraged, went basically unused in water rising
  - [x] ![](https://res.plexion.dev/minecraft/item/snowball.png) slowball
    - [x] slows down any player it hits
    - can make 'Snow' drop some crafting item for other items (like the prismarine shard in WR)
    - combine ^ with iron or smth to get regular snowball (slowball)
  - [x] ![](https://res.plexion.dev/minecraft/item/iron_boots.png) ice skates
    - work same as leather boots default
    - [x] gives speed to allow you to "skate" across the snow
    - [ ] slowly lose durability?
  - [x] ![](https://res.plexion.dev/minecraft/item/ice.png) ice platform
    - [x] use to create a small ice platform below you
    - only lasts for a short amount of time
    - duel tnt style
    - [x] crafting recipe
    - [x] refer to **todo** in `system/ice_platform/go`!!!!
  - [x] ![](https://res.plexion.dev/minecraft/item/splash_potion.png) quick levitation
    - [x] gives the player fast accelerating levitation
    - requires them to build to negate fall damage or die
    - (therefore not *too* overpowered)
  - [x] ![](https://res.plexion.dev/minecraft/item/stick.png) candy canes
    - [x] replaces dried kelp
    - [x] dropped from loot table of grass (along with snow)
    - [x] gives temp speed + absorption

- [x] add bundled resource pack?
  - would be my first datapack to do this
  - allows for greater flexibility
  - [x] style custom items (+naming)
  - [x] make it christmas-themed ‚ùÑ
  - [x] re-texture wither hearts to frozen hearts

## from beta test
- [x] add lava rising to #illegal blocks
- [x] add additional effects when in powder snow (you can survive to bedrock rn)
- [x] `player.height` is not currently being set
- [x] setup flow still says "lava rising"

- [x] replace nearby water with packed ice potentially

## from beta test 2
- [x] ensure all items have custom names (ice skates etc.)
- [x] automatically unlock custom recipes
- [x] potentially increase speed boost from candy cane
- [x] decrease chances of candy canes (+maybe snowballs) (especially considering length of grace period + potential for farming)
- [x] increase length of candy cane effects
- [x] ice platform does not activate (due to `stronghold` not being generated)

## final todo
- [x] trial replacing blocks on riser level to ensure snow is not destroyed
  - with both player hands + liquids

- [x] deaths are VERY broken
  - finally got something re-producable, will be fixed in lava rising when found

- [x] create `player_defaults` tag
  - used to apply defaults (eg. recipes)
  - given tag after to ensure they don't run commands again

- [x] increase chance of snowball drop

## from beta test 3 (final test before prod)
- [x] add tall grass loot table to match grass
- [x] decrease amount of candy canes
- [x] decrease amount of seeds
- [x] slightly increase amount of snowballs
- [x] maybe add a bit of strength to candy canes to encourage use in pvp?
- [x] decrease candy cane effect length to 6s (is 8 currently?)
- [ ] increase levitation amount slightly

other than that, custom items feel perfect. already have certain strats planned.
