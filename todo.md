## main
- [x] copy over lava rising
  - [x] replace 'lava' references with 'powdered_snow'
  - [x] replace 'lava'-esc sfx
  - [x] use more snow(ier)/christmas colours and things

- [x] give player slowness if certain blocks away from snow? (`slow_nearby_distance`)
  - ^ i don't think you can trigger the powdered snow effect manually
  - will trial it out

## QOL
- [ ] double food drops?
- [ ] add some sort of snow food?

## extras
- [ ] add custom items (like water rising)
  - ensure these items are encouraged, went basically unused in water rising

- [ ] add bundled resource pack?
  - would be my first datapack to do this
  - allows for greater flexibility
  - [ ] make it christmas-themed ‚ùÑ

## from beta test
- [x] add lava rising to #illegal blocks
- [ ] add additional effects when in powder snow (you can survive to bedrock rn)
- [ ] `player.height` is not currently being set
- [ ] setup flow still says "lava rising"

- [ ] replace nearby water with packed ice potentially
